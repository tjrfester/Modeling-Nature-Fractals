# Modeling-Nature-Fractals
Here is a collection of Pov-Ray scripts modeling fractal structures. While there are some fractals in my other repositories as well (in particular in the branching repository) this one here is dedicated exclusively to fractals.  

I am starting with fractals created by Lindenmayer-systems. The systems are set up and transformed into Pov-Ray scripts using Perl. (This may be a bit oudated - feel free to write something more modern...) 
I have produced 5 different fractals using this approach, present in the respository and presented here as pictures.

Apart of this approach the following fractals have been produced by nested loops.
